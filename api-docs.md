# API Documentation
Here is a list of APIs for the various platforms we hope to cover.

## PYTHON API

### Facebook and Instagram

Very similar to Instagram. Facebook and Instagram (naturally) share common sources.
It appears there are at least two types of APIs for them one that gives access to the business and creators accounts and another for consumers.
Without testing the two python wrappers below, I will assume they are for the consumers. This is important because you cannot access consumer accounts using business and creator APIs.

**Instagram**
[instagram-private-api](https://pypi.org/project/instagram-private-api/)

**Facebook**
[python-facebook-api](https://pypi.org/project/python-facebook-api/)

**Pinterest**
[pinterest-api](https://pypi.org/project/pinterest-api/)


*I will add to this as I think of/find more APIs. Feel free to fork project and add any you know of.*
